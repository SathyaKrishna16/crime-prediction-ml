# Crime Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project explores crime occurrence prediction using machine learning models such as SVM and Random Forest, focused on crime-related patterns from social media data.

## 🔍 Project Summary
The goal of the project is to:
- Predict types and rates of crimes based on historical and social data.
- Assist law enforcement in identifying potential hotspots and crime trends.
- Apply SVM and Random Forest algorithms on preprocessed social data.
